# imgproc

Fork from [QtOpenCV](https://github.com/dbzhang800/QtOpenCV)'s example: imageprocess.

QtOpenCV is an amazing integration of OpenCV and Qt(cv::Mat <==> QImage). I highly recommend to star it.

## Changes

- Change enviroment to Visual Studio 2017 + Qt 5.9.1
- Added Icon and Toolbar for MainWindow.
- Fixed sync bug when wheel event.
- Finished the TODO: sync with the scrollbar.
